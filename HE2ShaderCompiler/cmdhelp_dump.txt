Dump command usage:

he2shadercompiler dump <file> <options>

-------------------------------------------------

Dumps the compied shader(s) of a shader object file. For more info about the
shader variants in a file, check out the "info" command and use the -pm command
to see a permutation map.

You have to specify if you want to dump a specific compiled shader variants,
or specify to dump all.

By default, decompiled hlsl bytecode will be dumped, but you can also have the binaries
dumped if you want to process it with another tool.

Files are dumped next to the input file when no output directory is specified with -od

    -odir <directory>   Output directory

    -i <index>          Dump a specific shader variant
    -all                Dump all shader variants

    -bin                Dump binary data
    -noasm              Don't dump hlsl bytecode
