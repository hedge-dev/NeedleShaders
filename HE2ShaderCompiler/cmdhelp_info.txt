    -pm                 Show permutation map with 8 columns

    -pmo <order>        Change the order in which the permutation map features should be displayed (e.g. 3,0,2,1)
    -pmov <order>       Same as -pmo, but remap the permutation indices to be as if it the shader were compiled in the specified order
